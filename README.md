# A Recommended Systems using Movielens Dataset

#### Repository Description
This repository explores Movie Recommendation Systems using the MovieLens datasets collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota.

The repository includes three Jupyter Notebooks:

**[1. Movie_Recom_Sys_ML.ipynb:] (https://github.com/ashkan-bozorgzad/Recommended_Systems_Movie/blob/test/Movie_Recom_Sys_ML.ipynb)** This notebook covers:
+ Exploratory Data Analysis of the MovieLens dataset.
+ Method 1: Recommending Similar Movies using Correlation.
+ Method 2: Recommending Similar Movies using Cosine Similarity with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
+ Method 3: Recommending Similar Users using Cosine Similarity with KNN. Link to Movie_Recom_Sys_ML.ipynb: Movie_Recom_Sys_ML.ipynb

**2. Movie_Recom_sys_DL1.ipynb:**
This notebook focuses on Movie Recommendation Systems using a Retrieval approach.

**3. Movie_Recom_sys_DL2.ipynb:**
This notebook explores Movie Recommendation Systems using a Ranking approach.
